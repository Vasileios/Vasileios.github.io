* Arctos

*Arctos* is a research organisation which deals with sonification and visualisation of scientific data.
Arctos founded by Vasilis Agiomyrgianakis, Ioannis Zannos and Fiori Anastasia Metallinou in 2016 in Athens Greece.

Our goal is to extend the visualisation and sonification methods and techniques in examining and interpret data for scientific and artistic purposes. The main goal is to experiment with new technologies in domains such as VR and AR providing an experience of immersion. Our aim is to build an environment which provides an alternate way in examining and analysing scientific data. Moreover, in this project we are interested in exploring the aesthetic potential of data interpretation for visualisation and sonification purposes.
