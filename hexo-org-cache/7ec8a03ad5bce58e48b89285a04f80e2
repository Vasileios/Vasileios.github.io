The main goal is to experiment with new technologies in domains such as VR and AR providing an experience of immersion. Our aim is to build an environment which provides an alternate way in examining and analysing scientific data. Moreover, in this project we are interested in exploring the aesthetic potential of data interpretation for visualisation and sonification purposes.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}
